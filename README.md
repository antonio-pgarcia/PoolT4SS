# Pool/T4SS

Plasmid T4SS Common Pool Simulation

## Description

This a simple toy model which simulates a common pool where the shared resource is the set 
of genes required to express the T4SS conjugative machinery. Two plasmid are simulated, 
one of them, the plasmid P1 contain all genes required for being conjugative and the 
plasmid P2 is a cheater plasmid requiring the presence of plasmid P1 in order to get 
transferred to other cells. The loss of T4SS conjugative genes in theory provides to
the cheater plasmid P2 a competitive advantage eliminating the metabolic burden 
imposed by the conjugative pili expression. Therefore, the plasmid P2 could have a 
better vertical transmission performance when compared to the original plasmid P1.
